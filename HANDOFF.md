# Dev Session Handoff

## Context
- **Workspace:** `/Users/anton/.openclaw/workspace-dev`
- **Agent:** `dev` (👨‍💻)
- **Framework:** Pro-Workflow (Split Memory, Learned Rules)

## Current State
- `workspace-dev` initialized.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `rules/` directory created.
- `LEARNED.md` initialized for self-correcting memory.
- `openclaw.json` updated with the `dev` agent.

## Next Steps for Dev Agent
1. **Explore the Workspace:** Check `rules/` for any project-specific guidance.
2. **Apply Patterns:** Use the 80/20 ratio (AI code, Human review).
3. **Log Learnings:** Any setup issues should be logged to `LEARNED.md`.
4. **Deploy to Cloud:** Prepare for the Railway deployment of the Cloud-Sentry.

## Shared Memory
- Refer to `~/.pro-workflow/data.db` for global engineer preferences (once populated).

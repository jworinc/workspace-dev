Mission Control Health Endpoint Specification

Endpoint: GET /api/v1/health

Purpose: Provides the health status of the Mission Control backend service.

Expected Behavior:
1. Returns HTTP 200 OK when the service is healthy.
2. Response body should be JSON with the following structure:
   {
     "status": "ok",
     "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
     "services": {
       "database": "connected",
       "gateway": "connected"
     }
   }

3. If the database is down, the "services.database" field should be "disconnected".
4. If the gateway connection fails, the "services.gateway" field should be "disconnected".
5. The overall "status" should be "degraded" if any service is disconnected.
6. If the entire service is down, return HTTP 503 Service Unavailable.

Edge Cases to Test:
- Database connection timeout
- Gateway network timeout
- Multiple services down simultaneously
- Invalid timestamp format
- Missing fields in response

Performance Requirements:
- Response time < 100ms for healthy status
- Response time < 200ms for degraded status
